# Patch 0.6.1

## About
I'm currently reworking Paytrack (formerly Rachunki) from scratch.
I found it interesting to work on and practice few new thind for me (pydantic, fastapi).

Last version of Paytrack has been working, but was not advanced nor SOLID, nor modlular.
This version is aiming to be so.

## Changes:
- deleted old code and started from scratch 
- made new models and rebuild old 
- made validators to work with models 
- deleted old tests, working on new ones (some unit are already done!)
- created Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml
- changed layout of project to be more modular, now it also look a lot cleaner
