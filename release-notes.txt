## About
PayTrack (formerly Rachunki) was fundamentaly changed.
It used to be a simple text app with bugs and a little bit of sphagetti code.
Now it is as professional, as I could have made it.
I added a lot of tests, now properly. There are new models (planed in miro to avoid
unnecesarry mistakes and complications).
The code is better, well structured and checked with professional linters.
More will come!

## Changes:
	- Changed code layout to be more modular.
	- Updated README.md.
	- Added Pydantic schemas and corelated tests (not mentioned in release before).
	- Refactored code with ruff to meet standards.
	- Prepared engine to work with FastAPI.
	- Added docstrings for modules, classes and function/methods.
	- Added new model *Budget* and removed old **budget** from savings. Made relationship between user, budget and savings.
	- Written more tests for models.
	- Written new validators.

## Known Issues:
- some docstrings may be inacurrate in models validators.
